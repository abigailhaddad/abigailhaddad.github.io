## Bio

Hi, I'm Abigail Haddad. I'm a data scientist working on LLM evals. I previously worked on research and data science for the Department of Defense, including at the RAND Corporation and as a Department of the Army civilian.

My areas of interest include:

- Methods for evaluating/classification of text data, including via LLMs
- Government data workforce/talent management issues
- Code-first data science and processes for better transparency and replication
- DC school data

Get in touch if you're interested in getting involved with/sponsoring Data Community DC or having me speak at your event.
