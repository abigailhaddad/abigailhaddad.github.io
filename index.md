- 📝 [Here are slides from a talk I gave to researchers and analysts about coding practices](https://github.com/abigailhaddad/slides/blob/main/Better%20Coding%20Practices.pdf)

## Blog Posts and Articles

- 👩‍💻 [Here is a blog post I wrote on inferring numerators and denominators from decimals](https://blog.capitaltg.com/ghost/#/editor/post/63d2d6482eaf220001392673), and [the code that goes with it](https://github.com/abigailhaddad/fractionUniqueness)
- 📝 [GPT-4 wrote this article on transitioning from Excel/Stata/SAS to R or Python and better coding practices](https://github.com/abigailhaddad/slides/blob/main/starting_r_or_python.md) and it's...pretty good.

## Coding Examples and Resources

- 📝 [This is a small repo that gives an example of calling R from Python and testing the results you get back against what you got from a function in Python](https://github.com/abigailhaddad/pythontoR/blob/main/README.md)
- 📝 [This is an introduction to coding with user-defined functions in R or Python](https://github.com/abigailhaddad/slides/blob/main/Improving%20Your%20Code%20with%20Functions%20in%20Python%20and%20R.md)
- 📝 [Here is some resume advice for undergraduates who are applying to data analysis/data science jobs](https://github.com/abigailhaddad/slides/blob/main/Creating%20a%20Resume%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Science%20Jobs%20as%20an%20Undergraduate.md)
